# LabDAO April Newsletter

gm and welcome to the April edition of the LabDAO newsletter. A lot has been going on, from working on the openlab exchange, to ETHAmsterdam, and new teams forming. Let's get right into it!

## New here?

LabDAO is a decentralized organization made up of individuals from across the world working to accelerate life science innovation and collaboration. We are building an open-source and community-owned protocol where users can exchange research services, and find collaborators.

## Technology News

### Our first OpenLab Transaction!

We are pleased to report that on April 11, 2022, we were able to run our first ever transaction on OpenLab. We deployed our smart contracts on the Mumbai-Polygon Testnet. We hope this is the first of many, and gives the backbone for researchers to start deploying their tools on OpenLab. Check out the tweet with the announcement [here](https://twitter.com/lab_dao/status/1513634609493422082?s=20&t=JOnzK5GuwWuTLZNZUJw3uA)

### OpenLab CLI improvements

We have a basic version of the exchange client running on the "cli-subgraph-a" branch, which you can find [here](https://github.com/labdao/openlab-cli/tree/cli-subgraph-a). You can install the package, and run a few commands to see the additions. Check out the issues labeled on the github to see where you can get involved!
