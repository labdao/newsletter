# LabDAO April Newsletter

gm and welcome to the April edition of the LabDAO newsletter. A lot has been going on, from working on the openlab exchange, to ETHAmsterdam, and new teams forming. Let's get right into it!

## New here?

LabDAO is a decentralized organization made up of individuals from across the world working to accelerate life science innovation and collaboration. We are building an open-source and community-owned protocol where users can exchange research services, and find collaborators.

If youâ€™re interested in learning more about LabDAO, check out our latest article on LabDAO [here](https://mirror.xyz/niklasrindtorff.eth/lz_8uK8sStkl8pa35FDCQkCblROeOREn3Y3Tcpl7vVk).

## Technology News

### Our first OpenLab Transaction!

We are pleased to report that on April 11, 2022, we ran our first ever transaction on OpenLab. We deployed our smart contracts on Polygon's Mumbai Testnet. This is the first of many, and gives the backbone for researchers to start deploying their tools on OpenLab. Check out the tweet with the announcement [here](https://twitter.com/lab_dao/status/1513634609493422082?s=20&t=JOnzK5GuwWuTLZNZUJw3uA)

### OpenLab CLI improvements

We have a basic version of the exchange client running on the "cli-subgraph-a" branch, which you can find [here](https://github.com/labdao/openlab-cli/tree/cli-subgraph-a). You can install the package, and run a few commands to see the additions. Check out the issues labeled on the GitHub to see where you can get involved! 

### LabDAO Team News and Updates

Our compound engineering team is working on a variety of tools to be available for when we launch our open beta in May. The team has been making progress on a pipeline for represting learing methods for proteins. 

We have also started an **Image Analysis** team. If you have tools that you'd like to deploy on OpenLab hop into our [discord](https://discord.gg/JwbuVz5v), and tell us about your tool. We have meetings every Sunday at 5pm EST on the Hangout voice chat in discord. Feel free to hop on and listen in if you can! 

## Community News

### intros.ai integration

We've integrated intros.ai into our community, which allows us to have 1-on-1 calls between members of LabDAO, so we can get to know each other, and grow our own personal network. Check out the pinned message in the general channel on Discord to learn how to get inovlved

### Revamped Custom Onboarding

We're working closely with the DAO Quest team to build out our own custom onboarding workflow, to make it easier for people to get involved with LabDAO. We are also creating a custom Discord bot to have LabDAO specific commands, and better engage with our community. 

### Eth Amsterdam and DeSci Day!

Our launch team went to ETH Amsterdam for the first ever DeSci day! We spoke about our plans for LabDAO, where we've been what we're doing. Wasn't able to attend? Don't worry! We've got the whole of DeSci day recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01RUsvDZQQY)

### Crypto x Longevity Symposium

We had the first Crypto x Longevity Symposium, run by VitaDAO and Molecule, with features by members from LabDAO. The event included talks from longevity researchers, as well core members explaining what the future of research is going to look like. We had over 300 attendees for the Symposium, and we hope to do this again in the future! Watch a recording of the symposium, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ-rJAfjhBE&ab_channel=VitaDAO).

### Upcoming DeSci Conference in Berlin
DeSci Day at ETHAmsterdam was a massive success, and to keep the momentum going we're helping to organize a DeSci Conference along with our frens at Molecule, VitaDAO, and PsyDAO. DeSci Berlin will take place May 23-24, 2022. We are currently planning our speaker schedule, but expect a lot of talk on IP-NFTs, DeSci DAOs, research funding, and DeSci execution. [Register or apply to be a speaker](https://www.desci.berlin/)! 


## LabDAO in the wild

LabDAO was featured in a number of articles this month. 

CoinTelegraph wrote an [article](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2022/04/15/desci-tokens-help-improve-scientific-research) about DeSci, featuring LabDAO!

Jocelynn Pearl also wrote an [article](https://future.a16z.com/a-guide-to-decentralized-biotech/) for a16z covering an overview of DeSci, of course, featuring LabDAO!

Kevin Owocki from Gitcoin also included LabDAO in a [graphic](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1514951899987918848?s=20&t=JOnzK5GuwWuTLZNZUJw3uA) mapping out Impact DAOs. 


## Parting Thoughts

Before you leave, make sure to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/JwbuVz5v) and introduce yourself! We love getting to know people who are interested in DeSci, and want to work to bringing LabDAO to the world, together!
